# Usage

## New: Insert YouTube transcript directly into your notes (Mobile-Friendly)

1. Position cursor where you want the transcript inserted
2. Run command: **"Insert YouTube transcript"**
3. The plugin will detect YouTube URLs from:
   - Currently selected text in editor
   - System clipboard
   - Manual input (fallback)
4. Confirm or edit the URL in the prompt
5. Transcript will be inserted directly at cursor position with clickable timestamps
6. Continue writing your notes with the transcript content inline

This new command is perfect for mobile users and provides a seamless note-taking experience.

## Classic: Side panel workflow (Desktop-Optimized)

1. In editor window select link to Youtube video
2. Choose option YTranscript: Get Youtube transcript from selected url <img width="704" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-03 at 21 59 48" src="https://github.com/lstrzepek/obsidian-yt-transcript/assets/185352/9a0d7fd5-f830-408c-b7d8-73840e7e2d1b">
3. Transcription will appear in side window with timestamp <img width="1499" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-03 at 22 02 04" src="https://github.com/lstrzepek/obsidian-yt-transcript/assets/185352/1412b043-ffe0-4f56-a448-307afbba1bb7">
4. In settings you can control how often timestamp should appear (once for every x (default: 32) lines)
5. Clicking on timestamp opens video in that place
6. Right click to copy all
7. You can drag and drop lines of transcription or timestamp link

Both the classic side panel commands remain available for users who prefer the traditional workflow.
